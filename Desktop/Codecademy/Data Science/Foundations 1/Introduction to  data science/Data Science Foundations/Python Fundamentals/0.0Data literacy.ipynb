    "# Data literacy\n",
    "## Comments\n",
    "Ironically, the first thing we’re going to do is show how to tell a computer to ignore a part of a program. Text written in a program but not run by the computer is called a comment. Python interprets anything after a # as a comment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comments can:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Provide context for why something is written the way it is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Help other people reading the code understand it faster:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ignore a line of code and see how a program will run without it:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Print\n",
    "Now what we’re going to do is teach our computer to communicate. The gift of speech is valuable: a computer can answer many questions we have about “how” or “why” or “what” it is doing. In Python, the print() function is used to tell a computer to talk.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strings\n",
    "Computer programmers refer to blocks of text as strings. In our last exercise, we created the string “Hello world!”. In Python a string is either surrounded by double quotes (\"Hello world\") or single quotes ('Hello world'). It doesn’t matter which kind you use, just be consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variables\n",
    "Programming languages offer a method of storing data for reuse. If there is a greeting we want to present, a date we need to reuse, or a user ID we need to remember we can create a variable which can store a value. In Python, we assign variables by using the equals sign (=).\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables can’t have spaces or symbols in their names other than an underscore (_). They can’t begin with numbers but they can have numbers after the first letter (e.g., cool_variable_5 is OK).\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s no coincidence we call these creatures “variables”. If the context of a program changes, we can update a variable but perform the same logical process on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Errors\n",
    "Humans are prone to making mistakes. Humans are also typically in charge of creating computer programs. To compensate, programming languages attempt to understand and explain mistakes made in their programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python refers to these mistakes as errors and will point to the location where an error occurred with a ^ character. When programs throw errors that we didn’t expect to encounter we call those errors bugs. Programmers call the process of updating the program so that it no longer produces unexpected errors debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two common errors that we encounter while writing Python are SyntaxError and NameError.\n",
    "\n",
    "* SyntaxError means there is something wrong with the way your program is written — punctuation that does not belong, a command where it is not expected, or a missing parenthesis can all trigger a SyntaxError.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A NameError occurs when the Python interpreter sees a word it does not recognize. Code that contains something that looks like a variable but was never defined will throw a NameError.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Numbers\n",
    "Computers can understand much more than just strings of text. Python has a few numeric data types. It has multiple ways of storing numbers. Which one you use depends on your intended purpose for the number you are saving.\n",
    "\n",
    "An integer, or int, is a whole number. It has no decimal point and contains all counting numbers (1, 2, 3, …) as well as their negative counterparts and the number 0. If you were counting the number of people in a room, the number of jellybeans in a jar, or the number of keys on a keyboard you would likely use an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "A floating-point number, or a float, is a decimal number. It can be used to represent fractional quantities as well as precise measurements. If you were measuring the length of your bedroom wall, calculating the average test score of a seventh-grade class, or storing a baseball player’s batting average for the 1998 season you would likely use a float.\n",
    "\n",
    "Above we defined an integer and a float as the variables an_int and a_float. We printed out the sum of the variable an_int with the number 3. We call the number 3 here a literal, meaning it’s actually the number 3 and not a variable with the number 3 assigned to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Floating-point numbers can behave in some unexpected ways due to how computers store them. For more information on floating-point numbers and Python, review Python’s documentation on floating-point limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Calculations\n",
    "Computers absolutely excel at performing calculations. The “compute” in their name comes from their historical association with providing answers to mathematical questions. Python performs the arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with +, -, *, and /.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Changing Numbers\n",
    "Variables that are assigned numeric values can be treated the same as the numbers themselves. Two variables can be added together, divided by 2, and multiplied by a third variable without Python distinguishing between the variables and literals (like the number 2 in this example). Performing arithmetic on variables does not change the variable — you can only update a variable using the = sign.\n",
