    "## Turning a Real World Concept Into a Class\n",
    "Now that we’ve seen what classes are, let’s model a real-world concept as a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Designing Classes\n",
    "Now that we’ve gotten a sense of what classes and objects are and how they’re used in code, let’s turn a real-world concept into a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class is made up of attributes and methods (sometimes known as functions).\n",
    "\n",
    "* An attribute can be thought of as something a class has. These are often nouns or adjectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A method can be thought of as something a class can do. These are often verbs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s run through an example of this exercise with a real-life object — let’s write down the attributes and methods of a Dog (notice we’re capitalizing the D in Dog. Class names are always capitalized).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Attributes: What a Dog Is\n",
    "Let’s start with the attributes. What are some adjectives and nouns associated with Dogs? What do Dogs have?\n",
    "\n",
    "* A Dog could have a name and a breed. Both of those attributes would probably be Strings.\n",
    "* A Dog could have an age. That attribute is probably an integer (or maybe a float, if we want to represent age using a decimal).\n",
    "* A Dog could have boolean attributes like is_friendly. This would be a value that is either True or False.\n",
    "* Finally, Dogs can have more complicated attributes, like an owner. We could represent that attribute using another string, but what if we wanted to know more information about that person? Well, there’s no reason why we couldn’t make a Person class in the same way we’re making a Dog class. That’s right, one class can have an attribute that is an object of a different class!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods: What a Dog Can Do\n",
    "Let’s now think about a Dog‘s methods. What can a Dog do? Usually, these methods will be related to at least one of your attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A Dog can have_a_birthday() — this would probably increase the age variable by one.\n",
    "* A Dog can bark(). This might not relate to any attribute. Perhaps we want all dogs to bark in the same exact way! Or maybe we could add a size variable and when a dog uses its bark() method, that method does something different depending on the dog’s size.\n",
    "* A Dog can walk(). This would probably update a position attribute. As you can see, thinking of a Class’s methods can sometimes inform what attributes should exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Your Turn!\n",
    "Free response\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it’s your turn. Think of a real-world concept that you want to represent as a Class.\n",
    "\n",
    "List out the class attributes along with their data types (for example string, integer, or even another custom class like Person). Think of the nouns and adjectives that are associated with your object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then list out the class methods. Think of the verbs that are associated with your object. How will those methods interact with the attributes you thought of?\n",
    "\n",
    "After submitting your answer, you’ll get to see another one of our responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Your response\n",
    "Cat attributes breed, color = string age = interger friendly, meow = bolean\n",
    "\n",
    "Our answer\n",
    "Let’s model a Television.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our design of a Television class, we included the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* is_on — a boolean describing if the television is on or off.\n",
    "* current_volume — an integer describing the volume level of the tv.\n",
    "* current_channel — an integer describing the current channel the tv is set to.\n",
    "* brand — a string representing the brand of the tv.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Television has the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "* toggle_power() — Turns the tv on or off by using the is_on attribute.\n",
    "* channel_up() — Increases current_channel by 1.\n",
    "* set_channel(new_channel) — Sets current_channel to new_channel, the value passed into the method.\n"
